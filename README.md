## About KAFKA.MONEY
### Community-oriented Governance
The introduction of KAF (FRC-20) is to make sure that Kafka protocol is well positioned for community-led self-sustainability and enables shared community ownership for a governance system. A majority of KAF  tokens will be distributed via Liquidity Mining Incentive Programs and Community Incentives. KAF is a DEX platform token which incorporates tax creating clear deflation for its on-chain movement.

### Privacy-centric Yield
Using precompiled contract APIs that access the Bulletproofs and other Zero-knowledge proof protocols in Findora's Zei library, inputs to a smart contract transaction will be encrypted to a smart contract txn will be encrypted thus protecting users from front-running attacks and bring anonymity to a new level not enabled by other public blockchains. Kafka provides fair trading for an AMM DEX without sacrificing transparency or performance.

### Cross-chain Liquidity
Kafka leverages the efficiency of the Findora EVM layer to achieve transactions magnitudes of times faster than Ethereum with gas fees at a fraction of the cost. This is not only limited to FRC-20 tokens native on Findora. “Rialto” liquidity bridge interoperates with BSC and Ethereum. Users can migrate liquidity over to Findora with the Rialto bridge for higher yields to benefit from Findora’s cheaper and faster infrastructure.

## KAF Tokenomics
DEXes have undoubtedly proven to have the best product-market fit for highly decentralized financial infrastructure, and as such they’re the cornerstones in the DeFi ecosystem of any scalable layer 1 blockchain. The importance of a top-tier DEX can not be over emphasized, and at its most optimum, it thrives independently in its ecosystem alongside community-oriented governance, development and growth . 

The introduction of KAF (FRC-20) echoes this ethos: to make sure that the Kafka protocol is well positioned for community-led self-sustainability and it enables shared community ownership for a governance system, which will actively guide the protocol towards the future.

### KAF Allocation

1 billion KAF have been minted at genesis and they will become accessible over the course of 4.5 years. KAF holders can propose improvements and collectively decide on the optimum solution for the protocol.

The KAF token distribution is designed to ensure that market participants who actively engage with the platform will receive KAF tokens. The majority of the tokens will be distributed through the Liquidity Mining program.
 
5% to core contributors and co-builders with 6 month cliff after TGE  
5% to Foundation Endowment and co-builders with 3 month cliff after TGE  
10% to Fundraising Reserve, with up to 12 month vesting
15% to Reserve Mining, locked until governance voting by DAO elected leaders 
65% to KAFKA community as Community Mining Incentives


### KAF Liquidity & Mining Incentives
A majority of the KAF token allotments (65%) will be distributed in a targeted manner via Liquidity Mining Incentive Programs and Community Incentives to achieve a balance of high market utilization and a wide distribution of governance participants.  

The goal of Liquidity Mining is to incentivize growing Total Value Locked (TVL) and utilization rate of the platform. This will be achieved by incentivizing both the Liquidity Provider and KAF token holders. 
 
Of the 65% allocated to the KAFKA community as Community Mining Incentives:
25% is allocated to FRA Pools as mining incentives
20% is allocated to KAF Pools  as mining incentives
15% is allocated to selective LP pairs as mining incentives
5% is allocated to other pools as mining incentives

Liquidity providers receive KAF rewards that follow a vesting schedule of 1/3 claimable upfront or full claimable in 3 months - i.e. rewards can be claimed before the end of the vesting period but are subject to a 2/3 early exit penalty. 1/2 of early claimers' full claimable goes to the locked staking pool for locked Kafka token staking rewards, 1/6 are burnt. 


### KAF Taxation & Deflationary Mechanism
KAF features a unique deflationary economy design in which, at the KAF token issuance master smart contract level, a per transfer 0.2% tax policy will be enforced. The taxed KAF tokens will be first sent to a harvest address and go through a manual burn process on the burn day. As can be expected, all KAF tokens in the harvest address will be sent to a blackhole address or used for KAF buyback (KAF holders can vote to decide).

Effectively, KAF is a DEX platform token which incorporates tax that creates clear deflation for its every on-chain movement.
