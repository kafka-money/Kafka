# Kafka About KAFKA.money 
Kafka is the next generation AMM DEX that utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to drive cross-chain, privacy preserving yield. 
Secured by Findora. 

## Community-oriented Governance
The introduction of KAF (FRC-20) is to make sure that Kafka protocol is well positioned for community-led self-sustainability and enables shared community ownership for a governance system. A majority of KAF  tokens will be distributed via Liquidity Mining Incentive Programs and Community Incentives. KAF is a dex platform token which incorporates tax that creates clear deflation for its every on-chain movement. 

### Privacy-centric Yield
Using precompile contract APIs that  access the Bulletproofs and other Zero-knowledge Proofs protocols in Findoraâ€™s Zei library, inputs to a smart contract txn will be encrypted thus protecting users from front-running attacks and bring anonymity to a new level not enabled by other public blockchains. Kafka provides fair trading for an AMM DEX without sacrificing transparency or performance.
